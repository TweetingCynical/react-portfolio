        I believe that my work should be safe, ethical, data driven, and
        ultimately result in a better customer experience. I have a keen eye for
        detail and enjoy applying my data management knowledge to bringing about
        service improvement and, where possible, automation of admin processes
        to provide better value for money. I believe that my strong
        communication skills, with people of all backgrounds, allow for a kind
        and respectful approach to solving problems.
